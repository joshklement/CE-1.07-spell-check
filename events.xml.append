	<text>The commander of this impressive pleasure station says he can provide "services" as long as you've got the scrap.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED">Entire space habitats have been taken over by smugglers and want-to-be-dashing-criminals now, knowing that their less-than-legal services are in demand during this period of unrest. One of these black-market hubs is orbiting the near by planet and hails you.</text>
	<text>A station hails you: "Greetings Captain! You're the guys the Rebels hunt, right? We can help out, but we are constantly in need for scrap to patch up this space bucket we live in...</text>
</textList>

<textList name="BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS">
	<text>You overhear a conversation on the neighbouring table "So... you lost your interceptor?" "Been drifting for two standard weeks in the escape pod" "What happened?" "Maul beam hit to the cockpit. Almost took my arms off." "Tough luck." "Tactics, they knew our maneuverability was our strongest advantage."</text>
	<text>The canteen is pretty empty, but their sidewinder fang isn't that bad.</text>
	<text>A refugee buys you a second drink. He escaped from a nearby pirate sector and is glad to have found a better life here. Pirates burned down his crops and his whole family was starving for months. Food rations must be in high demand there.</text>
	<text>As you get your stuff you notice the bartenders tentacles are shaking. "Sorry Cap. Been working too long in the nebula. The chief tried to get as much pharmaceuticals as possible to keep us safe from the magnetic sickness. But it was we never had enough. At least I did not go insane like some of my friends."</text>
	<text>As you get your stuff you notice the bartenders tentacles are shaking. "Sorry Cap. Been working too long in the nebula. The chief tried to get as much pharmaceuticals as possible to keep us safe from the magnetic sickness. But it was we never had enough. At least I did not go insane like some of my friends."</text>
	<text>You are having a double nebula rake. Some union traders talk about the profit they made with exporting beacon parts to the expanding Mantis swarms.</text>
	<text>You are having a slime cocktail. A young Slug compliments on your choice of beverage and you have a little chat. He claims that he is employed in ship construction in the home nebula. Work is slow, they never can get enough raw ore for hulls.</text>
	<text>The bartender is happy to meet a Federation person. She tells you her story: After slaving away in a coreworld factory she later made a fortune by exporting luxury goods to the Slug nebula and bought this old station to settle down for good.</text>
	<text>As you sip on your alcohol infused pure water, you overhear a conversation at the bar: "Everything was fried, Cap. We ordered replacement electronics weeks ago, but the carrier did not arrive." "So you abandon the whole station?" "Life support was failing. Without spare electronics, stations are doomed in a nebula."</text>
	<text>You are having a Zoltan Peace Cocktail, it calms your nerves. A leaflet on the table explains that the trade union is looking for carriers to deliver beacon parts to uncharted nebulae. Their expansion plans are still pushing forward, even with the civil war going on.</text>
	<text>The station has a good micro brewery, you take the space-lager. Most unusually, a Rock sits at the bar, emptying bottles of hard spirits. He addresses you: "Hey you! Sell me industrial machines!" You are slightly startled and explain that you don't have any. The Rock nods. You can't tell if he is drunk or just not sociable at all.</text>
	<text>You smoke a hydrogen cooled water-pipe, sun-storm flavour, and then check the blackboard. Several refuges from near civilian sectors offer good money for shield components. Everyone wants to protect himself better these days.</text>
	<text>Some pirates brag loudly about their latest coup: "... and what do we find in the crates? Stone-plates, actual Rock literature!" "No way!" "What a letdown." "Better luck next time." "You don't get it do you? I told you I know these history guys in Zoltan space. They're gonna pay a fortune, you'll see!" "Yeah, sure..."</text>
	<text>You get a creme bowl and study the propaganda leaflets the Rebels have distributed here. They call on all freedom loving people to support their campaign by joining their forces or at last by donating engine components to their fleet.</text>
	<text>You are having an hydrogen-iced fruit cocktail. A Zoltan preacher is on space TV. He offers salvation for all peace loving people and explains in length the Zoltan's initiative to pacify the galaxy by buying ship weapon components and small arms at subsidized prices.</text>
	<text>The bartender seems to be intoxicated by some substances. He explains they used these hallucinogens all the time on his old pirate hideout, but now he is almost clean. "Some Slug trader came each cycle. The stuff costs a fortune, but we would pay anything, Cap. Good times... till this Fed cruiser blew the place up."</text>
	<text>The place looks much less rough inside than on the outside. Modern art-pieces are arranged in the canteen. The Zoltan bartender notices you interest in her collection. "I got bored by the homeworlds, so I came here and show these works to common people. Back home this is worth a fortune, but I feel only here beings truly appreciate it."</text>
	<text>Some union traders hang out on the bar. "Sister, trading with these things is sooo tedious. I got me this new translator, but I still don't get what they want most of the time." "Tell me about it. You want to hear what problems I got on my end? Do you even know how difficult is to get this stuff out of Mantis territory?"</text>
	<text>Some drunken cowboy-type ship Captain tells you his story, although you did not ask at all: "It's not the same like in the old colony days... Trading live animals, you know, a hangar full of cattle? Now it's only tube bred livestock from the Slug nebula. And I sell it to these robots, don't wanna know what they do with it..."</text>
	<text>While you sip your galaxy import you browse through an old Federation fleet manual, lying beer-soaked on the bar. You remember the lesson on interceptor defense quite well from the academy. The chapter explains in detail the advantage of burst firing missile weapons against this ship type.</text>
	<text>While you wait for your ration-smoothie, a union trader tries to coax you into buying his load of compressed nebula gas. "Okay, okay, who am I trying to fool here. We both know this stuff is worth almost nothing. I guess I have to journey to Rock territory again then I guess..."</text>

	<text>A nearby scout turns to engage, but then makes way for a cruiser that jumps in right in front of your ship. You are hailed by a Rebel general: "This is the RS "Questionable Ethics". We have you on our twelve. Raise your shields and fight to the death!"</text>
	<text>Disaster! You jumped in right under the nose of a well armed Rebel cruiser. They send a hail: "This is the RS "Big Appetite", our weapons are primed. Get ready to be targeted, Fed-scum!"</text>
	<text>One of the cruisers is already in firing range! They hail: "This is the RS "Dirty Unicorn". Multiple of our fleets assets are converging on this beacon. It's over for you!" You cut communication and get the engines ready.</text>
	<text>A forward cruiser waits at the beacon. They make contact while already targeting you: "This is the RS "Bad Day". Just wanted to let you know who is going to annihilate you." They cut communication..</text>
	<text>A single cruiser has broken away from the fleet to cover the beacon. They hail your ship: "This is the RS "Sweet Little Terrorist". Our unit is more than a match for your ship. And we will have no mercy!" </text>
	<text>A nearby scout turns to engage, but then apparently is ordered back. You realise why: A forward cruiser jumped in a few clicks on starboard. You are hailed by a Rebel general: "This is the RS "Bad Habits". You might have guessed: Resistance is futile."</text>
	<text>A single cruiser is sent out to deal with you. A high priority hail comes in: "This is the RS "New Toy". We just want to let you know beforehand that we will not accept surrender." They arm weapons.</text>
	<text>The fleet remains in formation a few clicks away, slowly approaching. The computer calculates that there is enough time to charge the FTL before they get in weapon range.

Almost missed you there, did we? Well my wingmen are closing in, but me and the crew are aiming for a promotion, so we will deal with you personally."</text>
	<text>Right after jump completion the computer puts a big red warning dot on the screen. A forward Rebel cruiser closes in and begins a targeting sequence.

A bright flash of white light fills the vidscreen as a Rebel battleship the size of a small space station jumps in. "This is the Rebel General Offensive Unit RS "Burst Damage" ..." The highly decorated Rebel dismissively stares at you for a few seconds and then simply cuts communication. The computer warns of multiple weapon locks.</text>
	<text>As you jump in you first think the Rebels have towed a space station here.
